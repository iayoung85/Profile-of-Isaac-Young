- 👋 Hi, I’m Isaac Young! Thanks for visiting my github show-and-tell portfolio and repository! I'm a biochemist PhD with 10 years of training in molecular biology research. I'm currently pivoting my career into working more with careers. I know what you're thinking; that I should go into bioinformatics! Well I don't want to close myself off from a plethora of different computer related careers too quickly! So currently, I'm exploring computer code and i'm looking for teachers, mentors, collaborators, and most of all, PROJECTS! I would love to offer my time to write code for anything really. I'm anxious to get started on a trickly problem where i can continue growing my portfolio. So send my a link to your github and i would love to study it, meet you to discuss it, and perhaps add a new desirable feature.
  - So far I've learned a bit about python, building computers, and setting up local area networks. 
  - A while back i worked as a teaching assistant for a general chemistry college course and one of the rules was that students were supposed to have different lab partners every week. I got excited by the problem and decided to write a python script which would allow me to take attendance, and then designate random pairs. it turned out to be a pretty complex problem and i think i've written a script that does a pretty decent job! check out my github to see for yourself. I'd love to hear from others what they think of it!
